# Algorithms and Data Structures
Projects

During the UniTN course Algorithms and Data Structures, students are required to complete two projects, each to be completed within a week. These projects involve solving complex given problems under tight constraints.
In this repository, I share my solutions for both projects, along with the corresponding input files and expected outputs.
